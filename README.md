# Loan-Prediction Problem

The two most critical questions in the lending industry are: 
1. How risky is the borrower? i.e. if the lender lends money to the borrower what is the likelihood that he will repay it.
2. Given the borrower’s risk, should the loan be provided to him?

So traditionally this work of approving the loans was done by the employees of the lending firm, where the Customer, to apply for a loan would first submit his/her documents to the Lending firm, where the employee after going through the applicant’s documents decided whether to approve the loan or not.

BUT since this process of loan approval required a lot of human time and effort, and moreover the process of loan approval was not that accurate, the companies decided to automate the lending process, in which the customer would just needs to fill an Online Form and get to know in real time whether he is eligible for loan or NOT.

The Loans data set represents a set of bank loan applications for a 3-year term. 
Predictors include debt-to-income ratio, request amount, and FICO score.
The target variable is approval; that is, whether or not the loan application is approved, based on the predictor information.
The interest represents a flat rate of 15% times the request amount, times 3 years.
The bank would like to maximize its revenue by funding the loan applications that are likely to be repaid, and not funding those loans that will default.
